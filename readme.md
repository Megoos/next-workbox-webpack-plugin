```js
const nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('@pwa/next-workbox-webpack-plugin');

nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin({
  // Optional, you can use workbox-build options. except swDest because of output location is fixed in 'static/workbox'
  ...WorkboxBuildOptions
  // Optional, next.js dist path as compiling. most of cases you don't need to fix it.
  distDir: '.next',
  // Optional, which version of workbox will be used in between 'local' or 'cdn'. 'local'
  // option will help you use copy of workbox libs in localhost.
  importWorkboxFrom: 'local',
  // Optional ,whether make a precache manifest of pages and chunks of Next.js app or not.
  precacheManifest: true,

  buildId: '6c071eb6-ab01-47bc-8074-71057afc1f64'
});
```

## How it works

For Next.js, It contains some of restrictions:

- Only works in not dev mode and on custom server.
- You sould use custom version of server for serving service worker. For your convenience, test server is included with this package.
- All of files will be generated in `static/workbox` because of exporting. It might need to add the path to gitignore.
